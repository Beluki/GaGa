CHANGELOG

* 2014/09/10:

    - GaGa tries to match the current Aero theme when highlighting
      items in the menu. We can't get a native look from ContextMenuStrip
      but we can try to integrate with system colors when possible.

* 2014/09/07:

    - Since GaGa supports .NET 4.0+, the included solution
      is now for VS 2010+.

    - Moved to ContextMenuStrip. Now it's possible to add sliders
      and other controls on the context menu.

    - Implemented balance and volume sliders.
      Based on an initial implementation by @joshimoo.

    - Some internal changes:

        "StreamsFile.cs" no longer exists. It wasn't really needed.
        Only StreamsFileLoader needs to know about the resource file.

        "Player.cs" now exposes all its internal methods.

    - Reloading the streams file is now faster due to some optimizations
      in the reader (using AddRange).

    - All the icons are now 16x16px, 32 bit.

* 2014/07/21:

    - Revised. Working on MSVC 2014 CTP.
      No changes needed.

* 2014/04/27:

    - First complete version.
