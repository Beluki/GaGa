CHANGELOG

* 2015/02/01:

    - Fixed: balance was resetting back to 0 on stop.

* 2015/01/30:

    - Fixed: dynamic menu items (those generated from the Streams.ini file)
      weren't properly disposed before regenerating the menu, causing a
      memory leak.

    - Fixed: multimedia keys were handled on key release instead
      of key press. This prevented key-repeat working on volume.

* 2015/01/28:

    - Fixed a bug: when failing to hook/unhook the multimedia keys
      the submenu option check wasn't updated.

* 2015/01/27:

    - Added multimedia keys support.

    - Added an option to auto play the last selected radio station on startup.

* 2014/09/14:

    - The menu position should now be correct even if the mouse
      is moved while it's being reloaded.

* 2014/09/11:

    - The streams filename is now uppercase (e.g. Streams.ini)
      for consistency with GaGa.exe and GaGa.dat.

    - Added a settings file.
      GaGa now remembers the balance, volume and last stream played.

* 2014/09/10:

    - GaGa tries to match the current Aero theme when highlighting
      items in the menu. We can't get a native look from ContextMenuStrip
      but we can try to integrate with system colors when possible.

* 2014/09/07:

    - Since GaGa supports .NET 4.0+, the included solution
      is now for VS 2010+.

    - Moved to ContextMenuStrip. Now it's possible to add sliders
      and other controls on the context menu.

    - Implemented balance and volume sliders.
      Based on an initial implementation by @joshimoo.

    - Some internal changes:

        "StreamsFile.cs" no longer exists. It wasn't really needed.
        Only StreamsFileLoader needs to know about the resource file.

        "Player.cs" now exposes all its internal methods.

    - Reloading the streams file is now faster due to some optimizations
      in the reader (using AddRange).

    - All the icons are now 16x16px, 32 bit.

* 2014/07/21:

    - Revised. Working on MSVC 2014 CTP.
      No changes needed.

* 2014/04/27:

    - First complete version.
